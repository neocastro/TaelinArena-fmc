### Fully modable

Taelin Arena is designed to be modified. 
Users can develop and publish their own heroes
using the upcoming proof language,
[Formality](https://github.com/moonad/formality). Templates
for art assets and highly modular hero libraries make the
task of creating new content refreshingly straightforward.
It also features first-class APIs that allows users to load
and run match replays in several different languages to
gather data, run statistics and do research. 

### Designed for competition

Taelin Arena is a competitive game: heroes are automatically ranked
and scaled for balance, based on winrate and similar
metrics. A pool of highly popular, balanced heroes is
periodically selected for ranked play, taking in account
different sets of human skills such as memory, reflex and
strategical thinking.

### Get-paid-to-play

Taelin Arena isn't just free-to-play: it is get-paid-to-play. Profits
obtained by sales of cosmetics are completely redirected to
hero creators and competitive players that thrive in ranked
modes, using [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum)
smart-contracts. In other words, company profits are
distributed to players, who win money by simply being good.

### Efficient & bug-free

Taelin Arena was developed in a proof language, allowing important
game aspects to be formally verified for correctness, making
serious bugs and errors scarse. In other words, it achieves
the highest score of code quality humanly possible.
