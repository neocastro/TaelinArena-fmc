Moonad
======

Moonad is the beginning of a long-term project aiming to build an entire
operating system built on top of type-theory. In the short term, it serves as a
big collection of [`Formality-Core`](https://github.com/moonad/formality-core)
structures, algorithms and proofs. Feel encouraged to contribute with your own
code. Anything is welcome!
